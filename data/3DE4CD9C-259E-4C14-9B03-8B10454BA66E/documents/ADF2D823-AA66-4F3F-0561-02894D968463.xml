   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This season’s work in trench F2 marked the continuation of a trench opened in 2000 and excavated in 2001 most recently. The trench is located in Area F to the east of F7 and to the north of F8 near the edge just before the drop-off down to the Tigris. At the beginning of the season the trench was believed to be 4.25 by 4.25 m, but remeasuring later in the season showed that (at its working level) it measured 4.35 (E-W) by 4.45 m (N-S). The trench was open from June 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="vertical-align:super" &gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to June 23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="vertical-align:super" &gt;rd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, 2005. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The opening elevations for the season ranged from 568.62 to 568.71 m, and the trench was roughly level across its entirety. The closing elevations at the end of the season ranged from 567.31 to 568.05 m, and numerous walls, features, and pits remained in the uneven trench. In general, throughout the season about one meter of soil was removed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;STRATIGRAPHY and LOCI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To start, a general cleaning locus across the whole trench (2024) was removed to clear away any contamination from the days between the removal of the off-season protective fill and the start of actual excavation on June 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="vertical-align:super" &gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Thereafter, I tried to coordinate any visible soils and features with those from the end of the 2001 season. Only the rocky area in the northeast (2018) could be identified and was removed in 2024. The wall 2019 was not visible, nor could the other soil-defined loci be distinguished. The only distinction present was between an ashy area in the south (2026, 2027) and the rest of the trench (2025).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first feature to emerge was a line of orange, burnt mudbricks in the SW corner. This turned out to be a mudbrick feature (2029), initially thought to be a platform, but later determined to be a brick-lined burial. The feature extended through the west baulk and into trench F7 (locus 7139). The burial was excavated as part of F7. Unfortunately, the segment in F2 was removed beforehand, so the complete feature was never exposed intact. The bricks included two orange burnt bricks, but the rest were yellow with pieces of yellow, green, and white clay. The feature was arbitrarily pedestalled during much of the season, so the soil underneath (2047) was a mixed locus. No surfaces were associated with this feature. Perhaps it was a pit cut into the levels around it that was lined with bricks for the burial. See the F7 summary, however, for a more in-depth discussion of the possibilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The next set of features (the first of two major contexts this season) became visible the morning after a heaving rainstorm drenched the site. These included an L-shaped wall (2034) from which a mudbrick layer/platform (2033) extended to the east. The fill around these features was divided into three areas: to the northeast 2030, to the northwest 2031, and to the south 2032. A circular concentration of ash in the area of 2030 was excavated thinking that it would be a pit but proved not to be (2028).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As we came down in 2031 we observed a layer of red bricky material (2038) that lacked brick-lines but had a distinct eastern edge. Its southern edge was less distinct. This layer is visible in the section, but again its depositional history is unclear. The soil underneath this was locus 2046, equal to 2041 (see below).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As we came down in 2030 to the east of wall 2034 and to the north of the mudbrick platform/layer 2033, we came upon a pebble surface with several flat-lying potsherds (2035). This surface was not continuous. It was removed using the HAP procedure. In its southern end, it could be shown to run under the area of 2033, suggesting that 2033 post-dated the surface. The sub-surface fill was locus 2036.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The removal of the mudbrick platform/layer of 2033 did not produce any specific brick-lines, although the edges of the feature were clear and linear. At the point where 2033 ran up to wall 2034, there was a potsherd standing vertically, showing that the two features were not bonded. The soil underneath was removed as locus 2037. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After reaching the bottom of wall 2034, its construction was observed: two staggered courses, each with one row of mudbricks. The dimensions of the mudbricks differed between the two segments of the wall, north and south. The subwall fill was locus 2039. Beyond 2033 and 2035, no additional features, surfaces, or foundation pits were associated with this wall. It did not continue to the west beyond the initially observed length, nor did it reach to the north baulk. If not an issue of preservation, this might suggest that the wall is not a four-sided structure, but some type of retaining wall or separating installation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both the bricky layer 2038 and wall 2034 were resting upon an ashy layer. With no features in the trench at this time, this layer was divided arbitrarily into two halves, in the west 2041 and in the east 2040. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While digging in 2040, the first glimpse of the second major context emerged. In the northeast, a plaster line running northeast to southwest separated the trench into two new loci: 2044 to the east and 2043 to the west. As we came down in 2043 there was an ashy concentration in the northwest corner (2048).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Loci 2043 and 2044 were cut by an ash pit (2042). The excavation of the ash pit (which also contained mudbrick chunks) produced a ceramic cylinder seal with linear vegetal motifs, KT F.2.2042.7. The soil in the ash pit at around 567.55 m changed to a pure soft ash and a number of human child toe and ankle bones started to come out of the western part of the pit down to 567.45 m. Not knowing whether this was still part of the pit, part of a disturbed burial, or part of the layers that the pit cut into, we stopped excavation here until the rest of the trench came down to this layer. At the end of the season, the question remained open.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To give us a window into the up-coming stratigraphy, two sections were cut into the walls of the pit (2045). These showed a number of plaster lines and mudbrick walls that would guide the excavation plan for the rest of the season. We stopped the sections vertically at the level of a plaster surface (2065). This surface ran up to but stopped at the line of plaster that marked the divide between loci 2043 and 2044. In the north section 2045 the area to the east of this line was mudbrick, now designated as wall 2050. In the south section 2045 the area to the east of this line was also mudbrick (now designated as locus 2051). However, this feature differed from 2050 because it also had a horizontal plaster line visible in the section (just below the working level of 2044). While continuing to remove 2044 in this area, we determined that this horizontal plaster surface was approximately rectangular and was nestled into the southeast corner of wall 2050, which turned to the west at this point. The prevailing hypothesis viewed this feature as a plastered niche within the corner of the wall. Later in the season, to the north of the pit a second plaster line emerged that was parallel to the first one, but aligned with the division between the niched platform and the wall to the south. From this, it is possible that in the north wall 2050 is a double wall construction, or perhaps the two are to be divided into the main 2050 wall in the east and then the niche (2051) and a secondary wall running parallel to 2050 up to the niche in the west. Future excavation may explain more, but the pit cuts through the important juncture. A thin plaster line in the east section of pit 2042 may be the last remaining evidence of this juncture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not knowing whether wall 2050 extended further west, we divided the rest of the trench into three loci. Drawing an imaginary continuation of wall 2050, the area to the south was divided into 2053 in the southwest corner and 2057 to its east. The latter was separated from the former because of its brick-like appearance. After removing 2053 and observing the section under 2057, it was determined that 2057 was a layer of bricky material (slump? debris?) and not a wall or other feature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To the north of this imaginary line in the northwest was 2054. The area to its east closest to wall 2050 was 2052. As these were removed, the plaster line marking the northern edge of wall 2050 extended as far as the western baulk. To determine the southern edge of the wall at this point, a section was cut along the baulk (2058), which showed the wall to be 50 cm wide. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Near the northern part of 2050 within locus 2052, multiple plaster layers were observed, but these were difficult to trace and were not always continuous. They may reflect debris and collapse rather than actual surfaces. One surface (2056) was traced enough to be sampled as a white plaster surface with pseduomorphs that ran up to wall 2050. The soil underneath this was 2059. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now that interior and exterior were clearly separated by wall 2050, the soil inside the structure was united into locus 2061 and the soil to the south (that is the "exterior") was redefined as 2060. In the extreme southeast, also an ‘exterior’ area, a pebble surface (2049), subsurface fill (2055), and two distinct soil areas (2062 and 2063) were excavated sequentially. At the end of the season, the nature of the linear distinction between 2062 (a gray pebbly soil) and 2063 (a compact brown soil) remained unclear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To the south of wall 2050 in the "exterior" area, a row of coarse broken potsherds placed horizontally upon rocks (2068) started to emerge along the southern baulk, parallel to but one meter removed from wall 2050. This may turn out to be a wall, but excavation stopped before this was fully determined.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To the north and west of wall 2050 and niche 2051, the "interior" area was filled with mud brick fragments, plaster debris and ash all the way to the north and west baulks. Only in the extreme northwest corner was the brick more concentrated. This later proved to be the location of the western wall of this structure, as indicated by a plaster line on its interior face. The wall was preserved to a maximum height of 1 cm above the plaster surface 2065, which ran up against it. This wall (2064) had a segment protruding southeast into the room. It is unclear if this marks a subdivision or an entranceway, as the important area where this wall could potentially join 2050 remains in the baulk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After removing the debris in 2061 down to the level of the plaster surface, the surface could be seen extending across the entire "interior" area and running up to and against the plaster-covered walls of 2050 and 2064, and the 2051 platform. Two circular features cut the surface. A small pit was filled with many small broken pieces of coarse potsherds and a few chunks of plaster (2066). A larger circular feature with a 6 cm-wide ring around it (2067) proved to be a 3 cm thick pit covering a compact black ashy surface/layer (2069) into which a complete string-cut base bowl was set (2070). Not knowing if the black ash continued under surface 2065, a section was cut into half of the feature (2071). This showed that the bowl was set into an area of orange soil. Surrounding this soil was the compacted ash of 2069, but beneath this was a pebble layer and brown soil. These layers were visible on all sides of the section, suggesting that they may extend under the surface 2065. The eastern half of the feature was left intact for future excavation. The function of this installation is unclear. The rim of the bowl was level with the compact ashy soil of 2069, together only 3 cm beneath the level of the surface 2065. This surface ran up to but did not cover the 6 cm ring around this feature, suggesting that the feature was in use while the surface was in use. Very few artifacts came from this feature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The plaster surface 2065 was removed using the HAP procedure to a total of 44.5 9-liter buckets, plus the HAP sample and the two-liter HAP float. The volume of this sample reflects not a single occupational surface but rather a series of superimposed surfaces. While removing the HAP square, it was difficult to separate each individual surface. Therefore, the whole sequence was removed as one locus. The sequence of surfaces included at least 3 plastered surfaces (with multiple layers in each) and one pebble surface. These surfaces were different colors (green, orange, brown) and separated by brown fill layers. The soil beneath the surface was soft and ashy (2072). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;METHODS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the season, a number of methods were used to excavate. Whenever the trench was largely empty of features, big picks were used to take down the soil in 10 cm increments. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When working in fill but within contexts, small picks were used but keeping in mind the possibility that surfaces and features might emerge. This was done in increments from 3 to 10 cm as needed. Surfaces were removed using trowels, and the large surface of 2065 and the plaster walls of 2050 and 2051 were exposed by popping off the debris covering them using a trowel. Trowels were also used to articulate the walls and edges of pits. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;FINDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the season, beyond the expected finds of pottery, bone and lithics, only a few small finds were recovered. The most unique is a ceramic cylinder with linear vegetal motifs from pit 2042 (KT F.2.2042.7). From pit 2066 is a fragment of an animal figurine (KT F.2.2066.6). From the debris covering the plaster surface were a number of grindstone fragments (KT F.2.2061.15, .21), a ceramic loom weight (KT F.2.2061.23), an animal figurine (KT F.2.2061.25) and carbonized wheat seeds (KT F.2.2061.5, .11, .24). From the layers of the surface itself was a stone bead with multiple perforations (KT F.2.2065.5). Possibly associated with surface 2049 is a large grindstone (KT F.2.2044.4). A round pounding stone (KT F.2.2063.2) was resting alongside an animal skull to the east of wall 2050 on top of locus 2063. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;DATING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most of the pottery has not yet been read, but the earliest structure probably dates to the Late Chalcolithic. The complete bowl with string-cut base (KT F.2.2070.1) within the circular pit feature contemporaneous with surface 2065 and thus the structure of walls 2050, 2051, and 2064, should date these contexts. Also, the sherds in pit 2066 provide a date as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The pottery from the later context of wall 2034, mudbrick feature 2033, and surface 2035 needs to be read before a date can be suggested. The reading of 2035 suggests an EB-Late Chalco date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to pottery, carbon samples were taken from these contexts as well as from the pit 2042, which should date the cylinder seal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;INTERPRETATION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two major contexts were uncovered during this season. The earliest consists of a structure with plastered mudbrick walls (2050, 2064) and a plastered niche (?) (2051). Multiple superimposed plaster surfaces (2065) represent the occupation levels of the structure. The finds suggest that the function is more likely domestic than industrial, but the surface was cleared of most occupational remains. Instead, clues can be found in the debris inside the structure (2061) and in a pit (2066) and an enigmatic circular feature (2067) that cut the surface.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The later context consists of a retaining (?) wall (2034) and an associated surface (2035) and subsequent mudbrick platform feature (2033). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The two contexts are similarly oriented, suggesting some degree of continuity between the two, but they are not placed one on top of the other. It will be interesting to compare the dating of the two.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;FUTURE EXCAVATION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the close of the season, a number of loci remained in the trench: 2042 (pit), 2050 (wall), 2051 (niche), 2060 (fill), 2062 (pebbly fill), 2063 (compact fill), 2064 (wall), 2066 (hole from pit), 2068 (sherd and rock wall?), 2069 (ashy layer in installation), 2072 (ashy-subsurface layer). Future excavation should work through these loci with the following questions in mind:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" style="text-align:left"&gt; &lt;span&gt;Can 2051 be confirmed as a niche?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li dir="ltr" style="text-align:left"&gt; &lt;span&gt;What is the nature of the double wall construction in the north end of 2050?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li dir="ltr" style="text-align:left"&gt; &lt;span&gt;How and why is the distinction between the soils in 2062 and 2063 so distinct?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li dir="ltr" style="text-align:left"&gt; &lt;span&gt;What is the sequence of deposition of feature 2069 and what is its function?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li dir="ltr" style="text-align:left"&gt; &lt;span&gt;Have we reached the bottom of walls 2050 and 2064?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li dir="ltr" style="text-align:left"&gt; &lt;span&gt;How does the southern spur of 2050 relate to the rest of the wall?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li dir="ltr" style="text-align:left"&gt; &lt;span&gt;Does wall 2050 continue west into trench F7?&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p/&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;</arch:string>
